# Price Tracker

Price Tracker is a simple record keeping app that you can use to track the cost of goods and services that you purchase.

On the date of purchase, enter the item, price, and where you purchased the item. The app stores this information in a searchable list that can be used for referring back to later.

By tracking the cost of goods that you purchase, you can become even more outraged at the increased cost of goods and services as you'll be able to maintain your own record of increased costs.
